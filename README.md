 Lab 28: Securing AWS Landing Zone Access with IAM Identity Center, Permission Sets, and MFA.
Lab 28: Securing AWS Landing Zone Access with IAM Identity Center (SSO) & MFA
üìå Overview

This lab demonstrates how to configure AWS IAM Identity Center (SSO) in a secured AWS Landing Zone environment. 
The goal is to replace root/long-term IAM access with centralized identity and permission sets across AWS Organizations.

The lab follows a step-by-step, production-like approach, including enabling IAM Identity Center, creating permission sets, 
enforcing MFA, and provisioning secure administrative access.

This documentation includes 80 screenshots for full traceability.

üéØ Objectives
‚Ä¢ Enable IAM Identity Center (SSO) in eu-west-1 (Ireland).
‚Ä¢ Lock down root user access and enforce MFA for all administrators.
‚Ä¢ Create and configure permission sets for secure access management.
‚Ä¢ Assign cloud-admin user with Administrator permissions across AWS accounts.
‚Ä¢ Test login via AWS Access Portal to validate secure SSO access.
‚Ä¢ Provide a blueprint for real-world Landing Zone access control.
üõ† Tools & Services Used
‚Ä¢ AWS IAM Identity Center (SSO)
‚Ä¢ AWS Organizations (multi-account structure)
‚Ä¢ Service Control Policies (SCPs)
‚Ä¢ Permission Sets (Administrator, PowerUser, ReadOnly)
‚Ä¢ MFA with Authenticator App
‚Ä¢ AWS Access Portal
üîê Implementation Steps
Step 1 ‚Äî Enable IAM Identity Center
‚Ä¢ Navigated to IAM Identity Center ‚Üí Settings.
‚Ä¢ Selected Ireland (eu-west-1) as the home region.
‚Ä¢ Enabled IAM Identity Center with AWS Organizations integration.
Step 2 ‚Äî Configure Authentication & MFA
‚Ä¢ Required multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users.
‚Ä¢ Selected Authenticator App as the MFA method.
‚Ä¢ Configured session duration = 8 hours.
Step 3 ‚Äî Create Cloud Admin User
‚Ä¢ Created user: Username: cloud-admin, Email: imegcu55@gmail.com, Name: Ime Ben.
‚Ä¢ Chose 'Send email for password setup' option.
Step 4 ‚Äî Assign Groups (Optional)
‚Ä¢ Skipped predefined AWS groups.
‚Ä¢ Proceeded with custom permission sets.
Step 5 ‚Äî Create Permission Sets
‚Ä¢ Created new permission set: AdministratorAccess.
‚Ä¢ Policy: AWS managed AdministratorAccess.
‚Ä¢ Session Duration: 1 hour.
‚Ä¢ Other sets: PowerUserAccess, ReadOnlyAccess.
Step 6 ‚Äî Assign Permissions to Cloud-Admin
‚Ä¢ Selected management account (285305988025).
‚Ä¢ Assigned cloud-admin user with AdministratorAccess.
Step 7 ‚Äî Accept Invitation & First Login
‚Ä¢ Email invitation received ‚Üí Accept Invitation.
‚Ä¢ Redirected to AWS Access Portal.
‚Ä¢ Completed password setup.
‚Ä¢ Registered MFA device using Authenticator App.
Step 8 ‚Äî Validate Access
‚Ä¢ Logged in via AWS Access Portal: https://d-9367a8c3c1.awsapps.com/start/
‚Ä¢ Verified AdministratorAccess across accounts.
‚Ä¢ Ensured MFA is required at login.
‚úÖ Outcomes
‚Ä¢ Root user access eliminated for daily use.
‚Ä¢ SSO enabled with MFA enforcement.
‚Ä¢ Cloud-Admin user created for secure centralized access.
‚Ä¢ Permission sets provisioned for RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).
‚Ä¢ Audit-ready Landing Zone security model achieved.
üìä Lessons Learned
‚Ä¢ Region Restriction Enforcement ‚Üí SCPs required choosing eu-west-1.
‚Ä¢ User Experience ‚Üí Email invitation streamlined onboarding.
‚Ä¢ Security Posture ‚Üí MFA drastically improved login security.
‚Ä¢ Scalability ‚Üí Multiple permission sets allow separation of duties.
‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
‚Ä¢ No external IdP integration (Okta, Azure AD).
‚Ä¢ Session duration limited to 12 hours.
‚Ä¢ Sandbox setup, not production.
üöÄ Significance in Real-World Use
‚Ä¢ Replaces insecure root user and long-term IAM credentials.
‚Ä¢ Enforces least privilege and centralized identity.
‚Ä¢ Demonstrates compliance with CIS Benchmarks & NCSC principles.
‚Ä¢ Provides a scalable enterprise multi-account access model.
